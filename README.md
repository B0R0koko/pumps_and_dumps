 <h2>Mitigating Class Imbalance in Pump-and-Dump Detection: A Comparative Analysis of Imbalance-Aware Algorithms</h2>

 <p>The cryptocurrency market has been subject to various forms of exploitation,
with pump-and-dump schemes being a persistent problem that can lead to signif-
icant price volatility and financial losses. Prior studies have focused on predicting
attack targets using machine learning approaches; however, these methods are
often compromised by class imbalance and biases inherent in historical data. To
address this limitation, we present a novel framework for manipulation targets
prediction. We employ two-step bias-minimizing data normalization techniques to
mitigate the effects of class imbalance and temporal heterogeneity. We also pro-
pose several innovative machine learning approaches including imbalance-aware
hyperparameters optimization and ranking algorithms. Our evaluation reveals
that proposed framework outperforms existing methods, achieving an accuracy
rate of 5% and a top-10 accuracy rate of 45% on a highly imbalanced dataset of
historical P&Ds events(imbalance ratio â‰ˆ 270). For further validation, we con-
struct a portfolio strategy based on predicted target class probabilities to assess
the practical application of our constructed models.</p>
